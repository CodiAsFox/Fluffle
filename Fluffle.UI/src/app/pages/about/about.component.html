        Fluffle is an initiative taken by me, <a routerLink="/contact">Noppes</a>, with the goal to eventually create a single
        unified platform for fellow furries with which they can reverse search artwork from a variety of sources. However, at
        the moment Fluffle only has support for e621 due to them providing an easy way for developers to integrate with their
        service.
    </p>
    <p>
        In its early stages Fluffle will remain closed source, but I might decide to make it public domain under the GPLv3 (The
        GNU General Public License v3.0) license in the future.

        <h2>Privacy</h2>

    <p>
        Fluffle has been created with privacy in mind from the start. Due to Fluffle its scope being limited – after
        all, you can only reverse search images – we can ensure Fluffle respects your privacy.
    </p>
    <p>
        When you reverse search an image on Fluffle, the image gets stored temporarily on our servers for processing.
        Processing only contains fingerprinting the image. That is creating an identifier which can be used to compare
        indexed images. Once the fingerprint is created, the submitted image gets permanently deleted immediately. The
        aforementioned fingerprint also doesn’t get stored and neither do the settings used for reverse searching.
    </p>
    <p>
        Said settings, from here on called preferences, are stored in your browser its so-called local storage. You can
        think of this as a small place in which websites can store a small amount of data. These preferences are only
        sent to Fluffle whenever you submit an image for reverse searching, and as said before, are immediately
        discarded when they are not required anymore for fulfilling your request.
